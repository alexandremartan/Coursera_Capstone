# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is designed to answer the Coursera's course : Applied Data Science Capstone.

The idea is to apply the theoratical knowledges about Data Science and Machine Learning achieved during previous Coursera's lessons to a concrete project.
This project still need to be defined, so stay tuned to see the improvements!

**Warning**
This project is currently in-progress and is designed to improve in the next weeks to meet the course requirements.
