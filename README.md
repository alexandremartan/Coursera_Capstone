# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is designed to answer the Coursera's course : Applied Data Science Capstone.

The idea is to apply the theoratical knowledges about Data Science and Machine Learning achieved during previous Coursera's lessons to a concrete project.

Two different projects are present in this repository:
 * Neighbirhoods in Toronto: training with k-means algorithm
 * Capstone project: analysis of Parisian neighborhood based on their restaurants and done by k-means algorithm.

The capstone project source code is in the dedicated notebook, a report and slides presentation are also provided.
