    "Paris, capital of France, is a model for its culture and life habits. With all its museums and architecture landmarks, the city of Light offers plenty of strolls for everyone and everything, including the inescapable French specialty : the cuisine.  \n",
    "In fact, Paris is acclaimed for its restaurants and its gourmet cuisine, but also for its caf√©s and bakeries, scattering all around the city.  \n",
    "However, with today's influence of Paris metropolitan area (_Grand Paris_), counting more than seven millions inhabitants (INSEE, 2016, <a href='https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=EPCI-200054781'>link</a> in French), and receiving millions of tourists each year, Paris basically owns every national cuisine in the world.  \n",

    "The idea of this project is to segment the Parisian neighborhoods into major clusters depending on the origin of their cuisine.  \n",
    "This origin will be determined by the surrounding restaurants, thanks to an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, namely 'k-mean clustering', and leveraging the Foursquare location data.\n"

    " * City mappers and institutions : based on the proposed clusters, these actors would be able to visualize if minorities are concentrating their activities in specific neighborhoods thus proposing them adequate accommodations ;\n",
    " * Restaurant owners : knowing the main cuisine of each Parisian neighborhood, someone who wants to open a restaurant in Paris could determine in which area this restaurant could profit ;\n",
    " * Tourists and residents : thanks to this clustering, choosing a place to eat will become easier as long as you know what kind of food you want, then just wander around the beautiful streets of a specialized area and pick the restaurant you're interested in !"
